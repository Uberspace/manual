Introduction
============

The GNU Compiler Collection is a compiler system maintained by the GNU Project.
It supports various common programming languages like C, C++ as well as more
specialized ones like Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D. It can be used
directly to build tools written in C or C++, but is also used behind the scenes
to build modules for Python, node.js, ruby and others.

Versions

We only provide the version available in the Red Hat Developer Toolset.
