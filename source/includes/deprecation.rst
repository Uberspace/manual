.. note::  
    About one month before the EOL date we will notify users, who have set the specific version in their Uberspace, by email about the deprecation. 
    Shortly after the EOL date we will migrate accounts using the outdated version to the next supported version. 
    
    For about one month after the EOL date, the expired EOL version can still be manually switched back to give you time updating your software. 
    The expired version will be completely removed one month after EOL date.
