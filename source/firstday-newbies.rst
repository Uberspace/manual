Is Uberspace the right product for me?
======================================

First of all - we're glad you asked!
Uberspace is a hosting platform targeted at people who want to look behind the scenes, do things we didn't anticipate and generally prefer working with a text-based console.
Our objective is to not only host the content you'd like to see on the web, but to also introduce you to Linux and basic shell usage.

A lot of our users started as newbies like you and enjoyed learning new things every day.
We don't leave you alone: It's very important to us to help you solve any problems you might face.

So, in short, Uberspace is the right product for you, if you...

* want to learn things about Linux and the shell
* want to bring something on the web with virtually no technical restrictions on the tools you use
* don't want to have things done for you but rather appreciate help on how to do them yourself
