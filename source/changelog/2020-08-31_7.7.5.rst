Changed
-------

* rspamd now uses the `ZMI ruleset against German spam`_ to improve spam
  filtering

Internal
--------

* We prepared our internal U7 repository to play around with AWX, a platform to
  execute ansible-playbooks reliably. We currently use gitlab-ci to run them.
* We re-enabled node_exporter to generate fancy graphs and metics, which we
  intend to share publicly in the future. At the moment we're using icinga2 to
  collect metrics.
* We deleted old, dead code that was blocking common ports like 6100 so users
  cannot use them. This is no longer a concern, as every user has their own
  network namespace now.
* Files created by ansible in ``/root/.ansible/tmp`` are now cleaned up
  regularly. This should speed up the backup process, as there were quite many
  of them.
