DKIM
----

We now create a DKIM key for your account, which you can use with all your `mail
domains </mail-domains/>`_. You get the neccesary information for your DNS
records when adding a new domain, or via the new ``uberspace records list``
command. You can check our `Spam protection article </mail-spam/#outgoing-mails>`_
for some additional information.

PHP 7.4
-------

*PHP* ``7.4`` has reached `its end of life last year
<https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php>`_. This means we will eventually
remove it. And you should switch to an officially supported version as soon as
possible (e.g. ``8.0``, ``8.1`` or ``8.2``).

Added
-----

- *PHP* ``8.2`` (`release notes <https://www.php.net/releases/8.2/en.php>`_)
- *Node.js* ``18`` (`release notes <https://nodejs.org/de/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce/>`_)
- *Node.js* ``19`` (`release notes <https://nodejs.org/de/blog/announcements/v19-release-announce/>`_)
- *.Net* ``7`` (`release notes <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-7>`_)
- *Postgres* ``14`` (`release notes <https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-14-released-2318/>`_)
- *Postgres* ``15`` (`release notes <https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-15-released-2526/>`_)

Deprecations
------------

- We decided not to deprecate *PHP* ``7.4`` just yet. To detect possible
  problems we just switched all users still on ``7.4`` to version ``8``. You can
  manually change the version back with ``uberspace tools version use php 7.4``.

Removed
-------

- *MongoDB* ``4.0``
- *Ruby* ``2.5``
- *Ruby* ``2.6``
