* `fping <https://fping.org/>`_
* `pwgen <https://github.com/jbernard/pwgen>`_
* ``libtool-ltdl-devel``

Updated
-------
* Updated our manual and error messages in regards to
  `xcvbn <https://github.com/dwolfhub/zxcvbn-python>`_. A library, we use to
  check and enforce password strength for user mailboxes.

Changed
-------
* Cleanup _journald_ logs, disabled *split mode* and set a retention time of
  seven days.
* Increased the process limit to ``1024`` (up from ``400``). Mostly because this
  is the lowest limit we can use and still support
  `Erlang <https://www.erlang.org/>`_.
