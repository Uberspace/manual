You're a commerical customer or just someone who likes to keep their paperwork
in order? Welcome to uberspace! Please read on to learn how to obtain invoices,
receipts, and how we handle VAT.

Invoices
--------

We offer two kinds of documents:

1. **pro forma invoices**: Issued before you make a payment. Can be used to give
   to your accountant or treasurer for transfer.
2. **receipts**: Issued after transfer. A document outling how much has been
   paid by who, to whom, what for, and at what VAT rate. For your books.

Both documents are available on the `Accounting page <dashboardaccount_>`_.

Pro forma invoices
==================

Please enter the name and address that you want your pro forma invoice to include as a voucher recipient and then select the amount you wish to transfer. Please note that a pro forma invoice is legally only an order confirmation. It does not qualify as an invoice within the meaning of ยง 14 UStG. However, you will receive a corresponding receipt after receipt of payment, which will then do this.
