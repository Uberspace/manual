Introduction
============

.. warning:: .NET scripts belong in your :ref:`home`, **not** in your :ref:`docroot`.

`.NET <https://www.microsoft.com/net>`_ is a server-side runtime implementation of CLR, the virtual machine that manages the execution of .NET programs. While .NET Core shares a subset of .NET Framework APIs, it comes with its own API that is not part of .NET Framework.

Caveats

Privacy

.NET collects `telemetry data <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry>`_ by default. This can be turned off by setting the environment variable ``DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`` to ``1``.
