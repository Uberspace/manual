Billing
#######

Servers don't come cheap! While we'd love to give uberspaces away like free
candy, providing servers incurs costs that must be covered. We try our best to
make the platform accessible to anyone, regardless of their financial situation.

Your **first month is always free**, without any commitment. Afterwards you
can choose if you'd like to keep your space.

Uberspace is a **prepaid product** with a **monthly fee**. This means you
first top-up your virtual account with us. Month after month we deduct the price
from your funds. If you don't want your account anymore, **you can cancel every
month**.

To learn more about how much it is and how to top-up your account, please
read on.

Trial period
------------

Uberspace is a rather versatile product. To give you a better feel for what you
can do using one, your **first month is always free**. You do not need to enter
any payment details during that time. That way you can take your new uberspace
for a spin, install your app, and ask us questions.

.. note::

  Technically we start charging your uberspace after the first full month has
  passed. For example, if you sign up on the 13.02., your trial runs until the
  31.03., even though that’s more than one month.

Towards the end of the trial period, we'll inform you via email. If you're
satisfied, go ahead and top-up your account to keep it. If you are not,
just don't do anything and we'll delete it for you. No questions asked.

Price
-----

On uberspace you can choose a price that fits your budget:

* **Budget (5€)**: You're on a tight budget? No problem! This price covers our
  hardware and people cost, but does not enable us to invest a lot of money into
  future development.
* **Standard (10€)**: The price range where you're getting a similar amount of
  computing resources other hosting companies. With this price you're helping
  us to develop new features more quickly and to invest more time into good and
  qualified support people.
* **Solidary (15€)**: Thank you! Paying 15 € per month supports our idea that
  everyone should have a say on the net – including those that wouldn't be able
  to afford it otherwise. By choosing this price, you actively support users,
  who are not able to pay for the Standard or Budget option.

If none of these options sounds like a good fit for you, you are also free to
choose a price that works below 5€ or above 15€ on the `Accounting page
<dashboardaccount_>`_.

However, **the service always stays the same**: We do not cut down traffic of
users who aren't able to pay a lot of money, or allocate more CPU to users who
pay more than others. We also strive to answer each support request equally.

Storage
-------

Each uberspace comes with **10GB of storage** out of the box. If you need to store
more data than that, head over to the `Accounting page <dashboardaccount_>`_ to
add more storage to your space. Each increment of 10GB is 3.00€.

Payment Methods
---------------

We currently offer **three types of payment**. In any case, money is stored in
your virtual account. As you go, we subtract your chosen price from the
balance.

.. note::

  Please consider transferring more than a month's worth of funds when you top-up
  your account. The different fees we have to pay for your payment make small
  payments ridiculously more expensive for us, meaning less of your money will
  actually reach us. If you are able to, **please transfer more than 10€**. You
  can always get your unused balance back using a refund.

SEPA Bank Transfer
==================

If you are living within the EU or rather the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA),
the most common way to top-up your account is using a **classic wire transfer**.

::

    Account holder: Jonas Pasche
    IBAN: DE09 5535 0010 0200 0039 78
    Bank name: Rheinhessen Sparkasse
    BIC: MALADE51WOR
    Purpose: Uberspace <account name>

Enter ``Uberspace <account name>`` (e.g. ``Uberspace isabell``) as purpose
(German: "Verwendungszweck"), so we can match your transfer to your account. If you'd
like to top-up multiple accounts in one go, you can specify them alongside the
respective amounts (e.g. ``Uberspace isa 10 bella 20`` for a 30€ transfer).

.. note::

  We never charge your bank account. All payments on your statement were
  initiated by you. If you notice payments that should not be there, check your
  *bank* account for a standing order (“Dauerauftrag”) and cancel it. feel free
  to use our refund option afterwards.

.. tip::

  If your transfer does not show within 3 business days, don't panic! In some
  cases the purpose gets mangled in transfer. Have a look at the
  `open transfers page <dashboardopentransfers_>`_ to manually assign the
  transfer to your account. If you are not able to locate your transfer in the
  list, `contact us <support_>`_.

Credit Card
===========

If you do not have a SEPA bank account, you can also pay via credit card. To
top-up your account that way, sign into the web interface and navigate to the
"Prepay by Credit Card" section on the `Accounting page <dashboardaccount_>`_.
From there, you'll be taken to `Stripe <https://stripe.com>`_, our payment
provider. We won't see or process your credit card information.

.. warning::

  We **do not** charge your credit card monthly. You need to either top up your
  account each month or transfer funds for more than a month, e.g. a quarter or
  a whole year.

Apple Pay
=========

To top-up your account using Apple Pay, use the "Prepay by Credit Card" feature
on the `Accounting page <dashboardaccount_>`_. If you're using an iOS or macOS
device, stripe will offer Apple Pay in addition to a standard credit card.

Google Pay
==========

.. image:: _static/images/google_pay.svg
  :alt: Google Pay logo
  :align: right
  :width: 100 px

To top-up your account using Google Pay, use the "Prepay by Credit Card" feature
on the `Accounting page <dashboardaccount_>`_. On stripe's page, select GPay.

.. warning::

  For reasons unknown the GPay button does not always appear within the stripe
  interface. For best results ensure that you are logged into your Google
  account. If possible, use a Google browser or Android device.

Cash
====

If you prefer cold, hard cash, we've got you covered as well. Put your cash into
an envelope, note your username inside and mail it to the address stated in our
`imprint <imprint_>`_. Once we get your letter, we'll top-up up your account
and inform you via email.

.. note::

  We experience very few cases of missing envelopes or cash. Nevertheless,
  sending money through the postal system isn't the most reliable thing. If you
  suspect that your letter got lost, `drop us a line <support_>`_ and we'll figure
  something out.

Refunds
-------

If you'd like to get unused balance back into your bank account, navigate to the
"Refund Credit Balance" section on the `Accounting page <dashboardaccount_>`_.
Please note that due to money laundering laws, we can only refund money to the
person that originally transferred it to us. A refund typically only takes a few
days. Feel free to `contact us <support_>`_ with any questions.

What happens when you stop paying
---------------------------------

If your account is going to run out of funds, we will:

1. Notify you via email
2. We'll send out another email at the dawn of the next month and flag your account for deactivation
3. If we don't hear from you for two weeks after that, we will disable your account. This means your web pages will display the message ``This account has been disabled``
4. If your account has gone for two months without payment, we delete the stored data

We will not come after you for borrowed money, but would highly appreciate it if you
restored your account balance to be positive or 0€.

Borrowing money
===============

Once your account has been deactivated, you can reactivate it by borrowing money
in the `web interface <dashboard_>`_. Please return the money after you
transferred additional funds. We do not automatically deduct it from your
balance. Also, note that you cannot borrow additional money if you already owe us.

Cancelation
-----------

If you'd like to delete your account permanently, navigate to the `delete page <dashboarddelete_>`_
in the web interface. Please contact us before deleting your account. Most of
the time, we're able to accommodate you by installing additional software or
delaying an open payment.

If you do not have access to your account anymore and would like to delete it,
just stop paying for it. We will delete it automatically after some time has
passed.

.. note::

  An uberspace cannot be frozen or paused, because storage is one of our biggest
  cost factors. Freezing it for free, but still retaining your data would cost
  us money, which we then cannot invest in new hardware and cool colleagues,
  sorry.
